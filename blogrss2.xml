				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>YES</strong>   !!               <strong> IT&#8217;S HERE </strong> !!       <strong>FINALLY !</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
We are highly delighted to announce the launch of our  <strong>official TSS website</strong> . <a href="http://tss-gndu.com/" target="_blank">CLICK HERE</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.tss-gndu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10750294_834619966578064_968879872548447569_o-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-233" src="http://blog.tss-gndu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10750294_834619966578064_968879872548447569_o-2-300x168.jpg" alt="First view of our website" width="300" height="168" /></a>                                                  FIRST VIEW OF TSS  WEBSITE</p>
<p>Building a brand-new website is  <strong>no easy task</strong>.  It demands a great deal of determination and consistent efforts. The idea originally came from  Mr. Navdeep Sidhu   ( the founder of the most precious The Linux Club, T.S.S. GNDU ) .  Classes were conducted on the subject by  Sahil  ( Secretary, Web Dev Club ).    Our  <a href="http://tss-gndu.com/wdc.html" target="_blank">Web Development Team</a>  accepted the challenge in high spirits. <strong>Mutual cooperation</strong> was  the watchword for  team members. Starting from scratch, they shared responsibilities and worked their way up to create this amazing  website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let me tell you guys about the site .  The website’s carousel covers TSS’ Hall of Fame and famous TSS events like UTPANN.  The site has links to various resources like the GAJJ, News Portal and TSS Blog.  ‘ Events ‘ page will keep you updated with upcoming events of TSS.   And what’s more !   Now you can even register yourself for the TSS events  <strong>ONLINE</strong> !! – through  <a href="http://register.tss-gndu.com/" target="_blank">TSS Registration Portal</a> .  Go, explore the site for  much more.   Site is compatible with laptop/desktop computers , while mobile version will soon be available,too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team is further planning to add <strong>video lectures</strong> and tutorials on syllabus-related topics for the benefit of students.  So  stay glued !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to hear more from you. You can share your opinions/feedback at  :  tss.gndu @gmail.com   or   drop us a message at our  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/tssgndu?fref=ts" target="_blank">Facebook</a>  account.  <strong><em>Happy    surfing</em></strong> !</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(My mother while reading the newspaper) &#8211; Hey, Why didn’t you tell me about this Flipkart “Big Billion Day” sale ? I would have ordered this hand blender, since morning. And look at this LG LED price !!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
This was my mother’s response when I returned home, on the day of Flipkart’s big sale . It triggered a few thoughts in my mind. Has e- shopping spread its wings to the middle-class domestic households of India?  That India, where ‘<em>Bazaar</em>’ has always been a one-stop shopping destination for all the needs, be it basic or secondary.  Is e-shopping the new, and perhaps, better face of shopping ?</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.tss-gndu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/shop-online-07.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-216" src="http://blog.tss-gndu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/shop-online-07-300x300.jpg" alt="E-shopping" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
With more and more players like Flipkart, Yebhi, Snapdeal and Amazon, emerging on the Indian background, customers are increasingly getting comfortable with the concept of electronic shopping. As per recent study, August-September period of 2014 witnessed <strong>200% jump</strong> in online shopping, compared to the same period last year. E-shopping offers many advantages – be it the reduced prizes, COD option, massive discounts and sales, ease and convenience or the huge pool of luxury brands , all at a click of mouse.We can shop <strong>anytime, anywhere</strong> , without worrying about the opening and closing time (as in physical stores ). Be it a national holiday, or a strike, online shopping has its door always open. You can compare prices, look for <strong> bargains</strong> and shop for brands, that may otherwise not be available at your place. Customer reviews help in buying the right product. Same-day delivery, gift pack options have further eased the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Similarly, the traditional brick-and-mortar store has its own share of benefits such as the hassle-free return process and personal interaction with the seller. Nothing compares to the good old-fashioned <strong>face to face customer service</strong>. Buying goods from the old-trusted and tested seller is always a wiser option, especially if the goods are expensive ones. You can try on the clothes physically and check if the color and design actually suits you ( a common issue for most of the girls ). Moreover,the instant you pay the amount, the item is in your hands.It saves from the headache of repeatedly checking the status of item and being physically available at the place, when the item finally arrives. The dangers of identity theft, insecure transactions shadow the e-shopping experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In conclusion, the importance of conventional mode of shopping cannot be ignored. Online shopping still needs to work on its reliability factor and trust issues. .Same-day delivery should  be available for more pin-codes. That way, it will be more of a  <em>happy shopping</em> experience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those who have never seen &#8220;The Matrix&#8221;,  the question of: &#8220;Would you take the Blue pill or the Red pill?&#8221; refers to whether you&#8217;d prefer to &#8220;remain in the dark&#8221; and continue to believe a comfortable lie (Blue pill) &#8211; or would you rather be privy to &#8220;the truth, the whole truth, and nothing BUT the truth&#8221; no matter how ugly or unpleasant (Red pill)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
For most of us our first thought would be to take the RED PILL ,to unfold the untold and to experience the unsaid…. to test the wisdom man has been gifted with and to challenge the capacities which lie within the human capacities … The RED PILL takers are the ones who had made the difference , the one’s who has lead the human race and who have changed the course of history with what they offered .. they were the one’s who have led the human civilisation to what it has become today .. they were the people with the vision and that is the vision which which the world embodies now ..</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
But whenever such talk is held the BLUE PILL takers are seen with disgust .. the non risk takers .. the no changers , the non eventful , the “mob”, without faces , no reason , no opinion of their own .. the one’s who will not matter in the end ..But ironically we become judgemental about the blue pill takers… The irony goes as follows: I mean every blue pill ideology was also once a red pill idea. The old stereotyped ideas were also once new and people found them justified and hence wanted to follow, practice and believe them ..</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
I agree if everybody in the world took the blue pill i.e. accepted the same old same old then the human race could perish as we might not evolve at all there would not be any possibility of determining what the human brain is capable of .. but in order to make the entire human race evolve ,everybody needs to accept that red pill idea and once that red pill idea gets accepted and universally applied it becomes a BLUE PILL &#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
So to balance out The World needs both the BLUE PILL TAKERS AND THE RED PILL takers cause that is how this human race would survive as a whole and we could become civilised as a community as whole .</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A good hand at technical skills but lagging behind in experience and exposure? Well ! In that case ,  AIESEC is happy to help .<br />
Founded in 1948 to re-establish the severely damaged relations between European nations after the World War II,  AIESEC ( Association for International Etudiante of Science,Economics and Commerce) became global in very short period of time. It’s a continuously growing network of high potential graduates and students. An organization – BY the Youth, FOR the Youth.<br />
Now the real question : Why should you care to  join  AIESEC ?<br />
AIESEC is not just a youth organization , but a whole new experience.Each year more than 10,000 members go abroad to take up the challenging opportunity to live and work in a foreign country. It is an opportunity to build international networks, develop leadership skills and gain hands-on experience.<br />
AIESEC INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS<br />
1. Youth Global Internship Programme (YGIP) :  It offers cross-cultural,paid technical and management internships,ranging from 3 to 18 months.<br />
2.  Youth Global Entrepreneurship Programme (YGEP) :  This 6-8 week program allows students to work on a development project with other AIESEC members from across the globe.<br />
Many prestigious international companies including Microsoft, UBS,ING,Unilever,TCS use AIESEC as a source of international talent. Till now, Microsoft and UBS have realised over 60 and 200 internships ,resp. from AIESEC .<br />
AIESEC contributes not only to one&#8217;s CV, but the overall personality of an individual.</p>
